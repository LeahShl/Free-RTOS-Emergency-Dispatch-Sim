# Free-RTOS-Emergency-Dispatch-Sim
‭The project is aimed at implementing a simulation of a city emergency dispatch system that‬ ‭handles various emergency calls from citizens, such as fires, accidents, or medical incidents.‬ ‭The system includes a central dispatcher that forwards the calls to the relevant departments‬ ‭such as ambulance, police, fire department, and others.
